# Pattern_Recognition
This repository consists of codes that I had writeen for the assignments in Pattern Recognition course SYDE675 University of Waterloo 2019.
The course started with Bayesian decision theory, feature selection and feature extraction then it moved on to model selection, cross-validation. Further, it consisted of decision trees, SVMs, Ensemble learning, Unsupervised learning, SVM regression, Linear Regression. Additionally, Neural Networks were introduced.

The course assignments made sure that we coded from scratch without using libraries. This enabled us to get well versed with the maths and learn to optimize our codes.
